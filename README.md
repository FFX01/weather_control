# weather_control
Webapp using jquery to grab weather info

This is a simple application that reads the user's location based on their ip address and feeds it into an api query for openweathermap.org. The application reads the json and displays important information in the html such as temperature, general weather description, and wind information.

It is expandable as well. All you have to do is create a new variable and use ```('element').html('data');``` to place it on the page. Check out [openweathermap](http://openweathermap.org) for information on how to use the json api.
